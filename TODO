Configure and build stterInstall script:
add options to what do you want to install
secure or version the backup so you don't lose your stuff on multiple executions
MERGE the files instead of replacing them

consider experimenting with zsh (+ohmyzsh)

Adjust vim shortcuts to the new terminal configuration

Try the git java
  if it works, add it to the install script

Add git shortcuts for navigation, error evaluation, git...
Configure git for java
Adjust git's go to reference functionality (that tags thing?)

Test the old man's ultimate vim configuration
Divide vim's configuration into multiple files
separate the basic configuration

Add scrolling to lukes build, I'm missing it
st truncation problem: window resizing, fullscreen etc loses its information
Word wrapping on window resize, resize, redraw, gnu screen, checkwinsize, commands... this problem is bigger than expected
Consider making your own terminal configuration
  How did he make the dmenu integration? - externalpipe patch

Using my build.... Text wrapping works in vim and in less.. Using less with highlight to read the logs temporarely
- consider switching bach to urxvt =p
also, tmux solves the wrapping problem and I needed to learn it anyway
