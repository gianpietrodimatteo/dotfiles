Install/Revert script:
Add options to what do you want to install

consider experimenting with zsh (+ohmyzsh)

Adjust vim shortcuts to the new terminal configuration
vim - consider vim sensible
Add vim shortcuts for navigation, error evaluation, git...

CONFIGURE NEW GIT PLUGINS
git - explore commit templates

Test the old man's ultimate vim configuration
Divide vim's configuration into multiple files
separate the basic configuration

upgrade bashaliases and bashfunctions with examples from the web
(do it using git merge)

change gdo to python, (or go?) - all bash scripts that are too big must be like
that.

make the i3 configuration file accept the bash variables

make the vim function sorting thing (or even terminal as well)
hint: adjust identation, then make it based on the indentation
you can compact each function in a line,
then sort alphabetically normally (may even remove the duplicates),
then revert the compactation of each function

turn vim into a real markdown writter
latex?

st: allow use of page up/down keys


swap fn keys (system bios, perhaps impossible)
Disable the Control-Alt-L locking screen
-- gnome and xfce4 does that
for gnome is
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.lockdown disable-lock-screen 'true'
For xfce??

vscode settings:
Control-s saves all. Remove other binding;
Missing: escape parenthesis/move foward thing
vim? vim easymotion?
Duplicate lines not working

Intellij Settings:
keymap - gnome


myrepos:
insert single entry

tmux installation file
